## Introduction

---

Welcome to my one-stop shop for data science. This repository will be used to keep track of topics I have learned. Unless otherwise specified, all code is Python. 

A short description of a given topic and subtopics covered. This list will be updated when new topics become available. Topics are listed in no particular order.

## Database Query

<a name="sql"></a>
### SQL

    ·
<a href="/Database%20Query/SQL.MD">Topic Overview</a>

**Definition:**  

>`SQL` is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. While SQL is the language, there are different implementations of SQL. Some include MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc, each with minor differences in syntax.

<a name="pyspark"></a>
### Pyspark

<a href="WIP">Topic Overview</a> -->

**Definition:**

>`Pyspark` is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open source, distributed computing framework and set of libraries for real-time, large-scale data processing. PySpark is a good language used to create more scalable analyses and pipelines. Pyspark provides similar functionalities to Pandas.

### General Concepts
<a href="/Machine Learning/General Concepts/">View Folder</a>
    ·
<a href="/Machine Learning/General Concepts/General_Concepts.MD">Topic Overview</a>

This section will cover more general concepts in machine learning that is applicable to all types of models. This will include topics such as: train-test split, cross-validation, supervised/unsupervised models, etc. 


<a name="feature-engineering"></a>
### Feature Engineering

    ·
<a href="/Machine Learning/Feature Engineering/Feature_Engineering.MD">Topic Overview</a>

**Definition:**  

>`Feature engineering` is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself.


<a name="regression"></a>
### Regression 
<!-- <a href="WIP">View Folder</a>
    ·
<a href="WIP">Topic Overview</a>  -->

**Definition:**

>In statistical modeling, `regression analysis` is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable') and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features'). The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion.  

e.g. Determining housing prices based on multiple features. (i.e. Total square feet, # of kitchens, Year built, etc.)  


<a name="classification"></a>
### Classification 
<a href="/Machine Learning/Classification/">View Folder</a>
    ·
<a href="/Machine Learning/Classification/Classification.MD">Topic Overview</a>

**Definition:**

>In machine learning and statistics, `classification` is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.  

e.g. Identifying if a patient has cancer or not, based on observed characteristics (sex, blood pressure, etc)


<a name="clustering"></a>

### Neural Networks 

<a href="/Machine Learning/Neural Network/">View Folder</a>
    ·
<a href="/Machine Learning/Neural Network/Neural_Network.MD">Topic Overview</a>

**Definition**

>A `neural network` is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It comprises interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each neuron processes input data, applies weights, and passes the result through an activation function, producing an output. Training involves adjusting weights through algorithms like backpropagation to minimize errors.   

e.g. CNN, RNN, GANs
  
<a name="computer-vision"></a>
### Computer Vision 
<!-- <a href="WIP">View Folder</a>
    ·
<a href="WIP">Topic Overview</a> -->

**Definition:**  

>`Computer vision` is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.  

e.g. Tesla's Autopilot; ability to identify pedestrians
