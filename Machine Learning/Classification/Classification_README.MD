## Introduction

**Definition:**
>In machine learning and statistics, `classification` is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.  
e.g. Identifying if a patient has cancer or not, based on observed characteristics (sex, blood pressure, etc)
